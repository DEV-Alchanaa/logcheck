  This release fixes a serious bug (FHS problem) and also fixes A LOT of old
  bug reports. I am sorry for being inactive on this package for such a long
  time, but now I am going back to active development. If you want any feature,
  then simply file a bug report.
  I am now going through bug reports and mails asking for the addition of
  ignore rules to logcheck and I will reassign those bugs to the appropriate
  packages. Now that logcheck has a stable mechanism for package specific
  rules files, please use it. Those rules will be definitely more up-to-date
  when they come with the package that generates the log messages to be
  filtered. If you have any rules that you would like to be added to the
  default installation and they clearly belong to a single package, then
  please ask the maintainer of this package.
  I would really like to see this package going from optional to standard
  priority, but I need quite some help from others to achieve this. The goal
  should be that - on workstation logging level - the user only gets an email
  when seomthing goes terribly wrong. This way, logcheck can be installed on
  all new Debian installations without causing inconvenience for users, but
  offering them a notification tool if something is really broken (or better:
  before something gets broken). And with the current size of the logcheck
  package, space should be no problem....
  * Moved offset data from /var/state/logcheck to /var/lib/logcheck to comply
    with FHS.
    Closes: #108227
  * Incorporated a shell snippet from Markus Gutschke for reading configured
    logfiles from /etc/syslog.conf. This way, logcheck can automatically
    fill /etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles with correct values.
    Update: Disabled the code for now because the sed expression does not
    take log file names starting with a "-" in account. If anybody wants to
    correct this sed expression in the logcheck postinst, please let me know.
    I just want to get this release out, finally.....
  * Changed maintainer to rmayr@debian.org.
  * Updated policy version to 3.5.6.0 (this really was a warp jump....).
  * Remove empty lines from rules files before using them. This fixes a
    security problem, because empty lines act as wildcards. Therefore
    one single rule file with an empty line would prevent all log entries
    from being displayed.
    (Idea and one line of shell snippet borrowed from Steve Smith.)
    Closes: #50966
  * Split logtail in its own package.
  * Split the logcheck rules database in an own package logcheck-database.
    Closes: #117537
  * Change naming of offset files in /var/lib/logcheck so that watching
    /var/log/nmessages and /var/log/local/someapp/messages will work.
    Closes: #94234, #108720
  * Fixed a small typo in logcheck.sh.
    Closes: #99619
  * Removed /etc/logcheck/ignore.d.paranoid/sendmail, since it is now
    included in the sendmail package.
    Closes: #113305, #118423, #111549, #110010, #111915
  * The removal problems should now be fixed (now not printing anything in
    postrm anymore - this seemed to be a problem with the debhelper-generated
    debconf cleanup stuff).
    Closes: #90836, #110412
  * Fixed handling of ignore greppings.
    Closes: #95592, #87225
  * Fixed another small bug with grepping ignore files.
    Closes: #118494
  * Do not install the INSTALL file anymore.
  * Corrected spelling errors.
    Closes: #90862, #99106
  * Renamed /etc/logcheck/*hacking* to /etc/logcheck/*cracking*
    Closes: #96319
  * Corrected the sorting of lines in logcheck.sh so that lines with the same
    timestamp get their order preserved.
    Cloeses: #111597
  * Changed string "Security Violations" to "Possible Security Violations" in
    sent mails.
    Closes: #113185
  * Do not use logtail.c from the original logcheck package anymore, but a
    perl version by Paul Slootman. This makes the package architecture
    independent.
    Closes: #89614
  * Run logcheck on reboot (using a line with @reboot in /etc/cron.d/logcheck).
    Closes: #97172
  * Make symbolic links in /etc/logcheck relative.
    Closes: #108370
  * Allow comments in /etc/logcheck/logfiles
    Closes: #111198
  * Renamed logcheck.sh to logcheck.
    Closes: #113842
  * Finally fixed the problem with logrotation.
    Closes: #70926, #79836, #118800

  This is from 1.1.1-10 (never uploaded, only internal testing), but repeated
  here because of the closed bug report.
  * There should be no more problems with duplicate entries in
    logcheck.ignore.workstation, because now this file is quite minimal and
    not generated from diffs to logcheck.ignore.paranoid anymore.
    Closes: #86726

  * Users, please use the newest logcheck version, 1.1.1-4 is ancient. Those
    bugs have been closed quite some time ago:
    Closes: #103397

logcheck (1.1.1-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * There should be no more problems with duplicate entries in
    logcheck.ignore.workstation, because now this file is quite minimal and
    not generated from diffs to logcheck.ignore.paranoid anymore.
    Closes: #86726

logcheck (1.1.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split the logcheck.ignore.* files into smaller pieces, one for each
    package that generates the log messages. Now there are directories
    /etc/logcheck/ignore.d.(workstation|server|paranoid) and
    /etc/logcheck/ignore.d will be a link to one of those equivalent to the
    handling of /etc/logcheck/logcheck.ignore. This is only the default
    configuration, you can of course remove the link and create your own
    directory.
  * Fixed a stupid bug in logcheck.sh that caused logcheck to mail some
    messages to the admin even if the last file in ignore.d or
    violations.ignore.d should have filtered it out.
    Closes: #87225
  * Now use debhelper version 3.
  * This bug (using '\(' and '\)' instead of '(' and ')' for automount rules)
    has been fixed as of version 1.1.1-7.
    Closes: #86678
  * There should be no more problems with duplicate entries in
    logcheck.ignore.workstation, because now this file is quite minimal and
    not generated from diffs to logcheck.ignore.paranoid anymore.
    Closes: #86726

logcheck (1.1.1-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added the directories /etc/logcheck/*.d so that other packages can drop
    their rules files into them. Therefore logcheck will only include basic
    rules in the future and will expect other packages to include their own.
    Please read README.Debian for details about this new feature.
    Closes: #80581
  * Fixed typo in mail message
    Closes: #80870, #85768
  * This bug has been fixed by 1.1.1-7.
    Closes: #81078
  * Fixed bug in 'conffiles' in the Debian directory. The path names were
    relative, but should be absolute.
    Closes: #81498
  * Added more rules for logcheck.ignore.server for leafnode and uptimed. This
    is a temporary solution, the next version of logcheck will have the rules
    files split on a per-package basis, so that these rules files can be
    integrated easily in the corresponding Debian packages. But I don't want
    to make all those changes at once, so this is a release featuring the
    logcheck.sh enhancements, the next one will change the config files.
    Closes: #80580
  * Added more rules for logcheck.ignore.workstation for pppd.
    Closes: #79974

logcheck (1.1.1-7.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Yet another upload due to problems with orig.tar.gz.
    I am really sorry about this (hmh@debian.org, sponsor).

logcheck (1.1.1-7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reupload due to broken orig.tar.gz file.

logcheck (1.1.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  This release can be considered a major release. Since I did not hear
  anything from the upstream maintainer in the last 6 months, I am fixing all
  those little bug reports (that the upstream author promised to fix with his
  version 2.0) now in the Debian package. Not very nice, when the new upstream
  version actually is released, but it has been too long now......
  * Added more rules and fixed some rules in logcheck.ignore
    (every time the same dumb "(" to "\(" translations....)
  * Changed 'BAD' to '\bBAD\b' in logcheck.violations
    Closes: #78969
  * Fixed the Makefile, because the creation of the ignore files did not work
    with current woody (the default behaviour of patch for creating backup
    files seems to have changed).
  * Fixed a bug in postinst - it was possible that it could overwrite a
    manually created .ignore file (a missing return statement - the check for
    this case was already in the script).
    Closes: #77615, #77002
  * Changed the postfix so that either the config directory /etc/logcheck is
    deleted when purging or a message is given that it is not empty.
    Closes: #69554
  * Changed the Depends line to have sysklogd | system-log-daemon since syslogd-ng
    now conflicts with sysklogd.
    Closes: #76657
  * The list of logfiles the logcheck checks ( :-) ) is now configurable in a
    file /etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles - so logcheck.sh should not need to
    be modified anymore. Thanks to Jeremy Hankins for that idea.
    Closes: #66686, #67728, #47339, #59899, #51302
  * The input of grepping the logfiles is now run through sort first, thus
    eliminating duplicate log entries caused by checking multiple log files
    with the same log messages in them. Additionally this should reduce the
    resource usage of the grep runs as suggested by KORN Andras.
    Closes: #59559, #74410, #51333
  * The config file /etc/logcheck/logcheck.conf is now sourced later in the
    logcheck.sh script, thus all of the configuration variables can be
    overridden in the config file. I placed it a bit later than suggested by
    Chris Fearnley (thanks for the hint), because this way it is also possible
    to change the DATE variable, setting another date format string with it
    (as suggested by jbr@datacash.com). Now there is a new default for the
    DATE variable in logcheck.conf.
    Closes: #71880, #63894, #74330
  * The offset files for logtail are now stored in logcheck's private
    directory instead of /var/log (thanks to Marco d'Itri).
    Closes: #59899
  * The bugreport regarding segfaults with mailx has been fixed by mailx as
    far as I know (at least it does not seem to be an issue now). Mabye in the
    next version I will try to do without mailx, but at the moment I do not
    have the time to experiment with various mailers and there sendmail
    interface emulation (therefore bug 68793 is still open).
  * I am closing bug report #50994 now, because it turned out (at least for
    me) that escaping the brackets automatically would not be beneficial.
    Since I started using egrep's features with grouping, etc. the ignore
    files got significantly shorter.
    Closes: #50994
  * Now logcheck identifies itself with each mail so that new users don't get
    confused by getting that much mails.
    Closes: #57751

    Stribblehill for the hint).
