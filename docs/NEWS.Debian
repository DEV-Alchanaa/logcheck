logcheck (1.2.19-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * As of version 1.2.19, logcheck no longer runs as root.  
    Logcheck runs as user logcheck which has been created 
    and added to group adm upon configuration.

    If you have customized your configuration, 
    you will need to be sure that your
    logs are readable by the logcheck user.
