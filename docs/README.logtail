SYNOPSIS
--------
Logtail is so named because it can be used to read the last few
messages in a constantly-growing file; but rather than showing a
fixed proportion of the log, it bookmarks its place and only prints
out the material added since your last visit. 

This utility was originally provided as part of the package
"logcheck", but can now be installed independently.
======================================================================
BOOKMARKS
---------
Logtail uses an "offsetfile" recording the inode number and length
in bytes of the file being tailed, then checks this data the next
time and uses it as a decimal offset to recommence reading from.
When no offset record exists, a new one is created and the logfile
is read from the beginning.

Inode information is taken into account so that logtail can detect
the case where a file has been replaced by another of the same name
(but probably with different content, so it's all printed) - a
common effect of logfile rotation.  On the other hand a file 
shrinking _without_ moving is a possible symptom of intruders
covering their tracks, and triggers prominent warnings in the output.

COMMANDLINE ARGUMENTS
---------------------
See logtail(8).

The first, compulsory argument is the name of the input logfile;
unlike tail, logtail cannot use stdin! 

The second, optional argument specifies the filename to which offset
records should be written.  By default it simply adds .offset to the
name of the input file, which leaves it up to the user to handle
security issues such as directory write-access; for any serious
purpose a dedicated offsets directory should be specified.
